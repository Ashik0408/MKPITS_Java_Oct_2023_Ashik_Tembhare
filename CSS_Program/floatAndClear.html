      <h1>IRON MAN</h1>
      <p>
        Iron Man is a superhero appearing in American comic books published by
        Marvel Comics. Co-created by writer and editor Stan Lee, developed by
        scripter Larry Lieber, and designed by artists Don Heck and Jack Kirby,
        the character first appeared in Tales of Suspense #39 in 1963, and
        received his own title with Iron Man #1 in 1968. Shortly after his
        creation, Iron Man was a founding member of a superhero team, the
        Avengers, with Thor, Ant-Man, Wasp and the Hulk. Iron Man stories,
        individually and with the Avengers, have been published consistently
        since the character's creation. Iron Man is the superhero persona of
        Anthony Edward "Tony" Stark, a businessman and engineer who runs the
        company Stark Industries. Beginning his career as a weapons
        manufacturer, he is captured in a war zone, and his heart is severely
        injured by shrapnel. To sustain his heart and escape his captors, he
        builds a technologically advanced armor. After escaping, he continues
        using the armor as a superhero, creating more advanced models that grant
        him superhuman strength, flight, energy projection, and other abilities.
        The character was used to explore political themes, and early Iron Man
        stories were set in the Cold War. Later stories explored other themes,
        such as civil unrest, technological advancement, corporate espionage,
        alcoholism, and governmental authority. Major Iron Man stories include
        Demon in a Bottle (1979), Armor Wars (1987–1988), Extremis (2005), and
        Iron Man 2020 (2020). He is also a leading character in the company-wide
        stories Civil War (2006–2007), Dark Reign (2008–2009), and Civil War II
        (2016). Iron Man's supporting cast has produced additional superhero
        characters, including James Rhodes as War Machine, Pepper Potts as
        Rescue, and Riri Williams as Ironheart as well as reformed villains
        Black Widow and Hawkeye. Iron Man's list of enemies includes his
        archenemy, the Mandarin, as well as many supervillains of communist
        origin and many that double as business rivals for Tony. Robert Downey
        Jr. portrayed Tony Stark in Iron Man (2008), the first film of the
        Marvel Cinematic Universe, and continued to portray the character until
        his final appearance in Avengers: Endgame (2019). Downey's portrayal
        popularized the character, elevating Iron Man as one of Marvel's most
        recognizable superheroes. <br />
        Tony Stark is the wealthy son of industrialist and weapons manufacturer
        Howard Stark and his wife, Maria. Tony grew up a genius with a brilliant
        mind for technology and inventions and, naturally, followed in his
        father’s footsteps, inheriting Stark Industries upon his parents’
        untimely death. Tony designed many weapons of war for Stark Industries,
        far beyond what any other company was creating, while living the
        lifestyle of a bon vivant. Fate would take a dark turn for Tony Stark
        once he decided to consult on a weapons contract overseas in enemy
        terrain. An improvised explosive device exploded underneath Tony’s
        transport, and he was brought to the brink of death. Awakening as a
        prisoner of the warlord Wong-Chu, Tony made a gruesome discovery: the
        explosion had sent a piece of shrapnel mere inches from his heart. It
        was only the timely intervention of fellow captive and engineer Yinsen
        that kept the shrapnel at bay.While held captive, and forced to work on
        weapons, Tony turned his near-death experience into inspiration. What if
        he could power an iron suit that would not only keep the shrapnel from
        killing Tony, but also help him to escape? Iron Man (Tony Stark)
        Combining their genius, Tony and Yinsen built a mighty suit of iron
        armor that would be dubbed Iron Man. This first suit left a lot of room
        for improvement, but it still did what Tony couldn’t do alone. Yinsen
        sacrificed his life so the final preparations could be made, and Tony,
        wearing the Iron Man suit for the first time, escaped and returned to
        the United States a changed man.With full access to his equipment, Tony
        built a new, more streamlined suit of armor—the first of many updated
        versions he would create—and dedicated his life to fighting threats to
        the world. IRON MAN Since that first suit built in a cave, Tony has
        created dozens of new suits and upgrades over the years. However,
        throughout the 50-plus Iron Man models, there are common offensive and
        defense capabilities found in most iterations. The primary weapon
        contained within every suit, the repulsor rays use energy pulses to
        repel and disrupt enemies and are generated through the suit’s
        gauntlets. The suit’s booster jets enable Stark to fly fast enough to
        break the sound barrier, and maneuver more quickly than any fighter jet.
        Iron Man’s helmet provides Tony with a heads-up display that gives him
        360-degree vision, access to information about his surroundings and
        enemies, and the ability to transmit and block transmissions along any
        frequency. The helmet also gives Tony a degree of resistance to EMP and
        psychic-based attacks. A weapon centered in Iron Man’s chest, the
        unibeam is capable of projecting dazzling light, and can also be used as
        a powerful force beam that is even more powerful than the repulsor ray.
        Each of Tony’s suits provides a full range of telecommunications,
        including the ability to jam and transmit on any frequency, and
        sophisticated artificial intelligence capable of piloting Tony to safety
        should he be rendered unconscious. Iron Man (Tony Stark) Beyond his
        all-purpose suits, Tony has created specialized armor for specific
        scenarios. Some notable examples include the Hulkbuster armor (so-named
        as its size and strength allow Tony to stand toe-to-toe with the Hulk,
        when needed), along with deep-space, underwater and stealth suits. One
        thing common to most of Iron Man’s recent suits is the integration of
        Extremis, an attempt to re-create the super-soldier serum with many
        modifications. When using Extremis, Tony can interface with his brain’s
        repair center, which allows him to rebuild his body from scratch.
        Essentially, Tony is able to merge his mind, body, and armor in
        unprecedented ways. He can “armor up” in mere seconds—with armor stored
        within himself—gains split-second reaction times, and can even generate
        new internal organs to replace the old. Unfortunately, Extremis is also
        vulnerable to being hacked, and the Skrulls and other organizations have
        done just that. REPULSING THE REPULSIVE Numerous villains have made up
        Iron Man’s gallery of enemies, with many of them similarly armor-based
        in order to counter Iron Man’s abilities. The Russians have created both
        the Crimson Dynamo and Titanium Man to try and stop the threat posed by
        Iron Man, and have fought Stark through numerous iterations. The
        Mandarin is one of Iron Man’s fiercest archvillains. A tactical,
        mystical and technological genius, the Mandarin sought ultimate power,
        and often Iron Man is the only one smart and strong enough to stand in
        his way. In fact, the Mandarin, working with warlord Wong-Chu, captured
        Tony Stark and indirectly brought about the creation of Iron Man. The
        Mandarin has returned again and again to pit his magic and intellect
        against Stark technology. A competing industrialist, Obadiah Stane,
        never lost his taste for weapons and was a great fan of psychological
        warfare. He took hostile control of Tony Stark’s company for a time, and
        though he perished in battle, his descendants are perhaps even more
        ruthless than he was. Another rival industrialist on par with Stane,
        Justin Hammer is interested in the accumulation of wealth and power and
        sees Tony’s altruism as a big stumbling block toward that goal.Other
        foes of note for Tony through the years have included the Ghost,
        Radioactive Man, and nefarious organizations like Advanced Idea
        Mechanics (AIM). FIGHTING AND SMITING Iron Man can’t always fight alone
        and has many notable allies and teammates. Stark is one of the founding
        members of the Avengers and is considered one of the “Big Three” core
        members, along with Thor and Captain America. While he has left the team
        at various points for personal reasons, he has always returned to fight
        alongside them again and again. He is one Avenger that can always be
        counted on. Originally, Tony’s secretary Pepper Potts and limousine
        driver Happy Hogan grew to be Tony’s two best friends in the world. A
        romance between Pepper and Tony fizzled out, but she and Happy found
        happiness together for a time, until his tragic death. More recently,
        Pepper has taken up occasional super heroics herself, with an armored
        suit Tony has created for her called Rescue. Former military man James
        “Rhodey” Rhodes became Tony’s bodyguard and trusted confidant. When
        Tony’s alcoholism got the better of him, Rhodey became the new Iron Man.
        Later, Rhodey donned a weapons-laden variation on the Iron Man suit and
        dubbed himself War Machine, fighting alongside Tony many times. During a
        mind-clearing vacation from Earth, Tony joined the Guardians of the
        Galaxy, making fast friends with Rocket Raccoon especially. While Tony
        would eventually return to Earth, Rocket’s technology has made its way
        into many successive iterations of the Iron Man armor. <br />
